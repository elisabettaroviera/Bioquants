    "## Overview\n",
    "This assignment focuses on introducing an approach to the task of genome assembly. The process of genome assembly involves taking numerous short DNA fragments, known as reads, generated by sequencing machines, and piecing them together to form much longer continuous sequences, ultimately representing chromosomes. This is achieved by identifying regions where reads overlap and determining their correct order to reconstruct the original genomic sequence. The task will be to process the provided sequence reads, detect overlaps between them, establish their proper arrangement, and finally reconstruct the genomic sequence based on these overlapping segments. For the purpose of this task, we will operate under two significant simplifying assumptions:\n",
    "1.  We assume the absence of sequencing errors, meaning any overlaps between reads are exact matches.\n",
    "2.  We assume that no read is entirely contained within another read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this exercise, I will develop functions designed to collectively address the genome sequence assembly problem. The sequence reads for this mini-assembly are located in the file named `genome-assembly.txt`. Each line in this file corresponds to a single read. The first piece of information on each line represents the read's identifier or name, and the second part contains the actual read sequence."

    "## Problem 3: Compute Overlap Between Two Reads\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent step involves identifying which reads overlap each other. To facilitate this, a function is required that takes two read sequences and computes their overlap. Given the characteristics of the input data, it is known that none of the reads are completely nested within another. Consequently, when two reads overlap, the overlap occurs between the 3’ end of the read designated as 'left' and the 5’ end of the read designated as 'right'. Furthermore, with the assumption of no sequencing errors, any overlap identified will represent a perfect sequence match. The approach to finding this overlap involves iterating through all possible overlap lengths, considering the specified 'left' and 'right' orientations. Within the iterative process, it is necessary to begin with the largest possible overlap length (equivalent to `min(len(left), len(right))`) and progressively evaluate smaller overlap lengths until an exact match is discovered. A function is to be implemented with the signature `def getOverlap(left, right):` which accepts two string arguments, `left` and `right`, each containing a read sequence. The function must return the identified overlapping sequence as a string. In the case where no overlap exists between the two sequences, an empty string should be returned."

    "\n",
    "With the capability to evaluate the overlap between two reads in a specific orientation now established, the subsequent task is to compute overlaps between all possible pairs of reads. This computation must consider both left-right and right-left orientations. A function is to be implemented with the signature `def getAllOverlaps(reads):` that accepts one argument: a dictionary named `reads`, formatted identically to the output produced by the `readDataFromFile` function. The required return value of this function is a dictionary of dictionaries. This nested dictionary structure should store the number of overlapping bases for a pair of reads in a given orientation. Overlaps of a read with itself are not meaningful in this context and must be excluded from the results. As an illustration, if the overlap size between read '2' placed in the left position and read '5' in the right position is found to be 21 bases, then the resulting dictionary, if named `d`, should satisfy the condition `d['2']['5'] == 21`. It is crucial that the structure and representation of overlaps within this returned data structure are fully understood before proceeding further."

    "## Problem 6: Find the First Read\n",
    "\n",
    "With the overlap relationships between reads now established, it becomes possible to chain them together pair by pair from left to right to reconstruct the order in which they represent the genomic sequence. This process is typically achieved by starting with the initial (leftmost) read, identifying which subsequent read has the largest overlap at its right end, then taking that identified read and finding the read with the largest overlap to its right end, and continuing this sequence until the rightmost (last) read is reached. The immediate requirement in this process is to identify the first (leftmost) read, as this serves as the starting point. This initial read is identified as the one that exhibits a significant overlap (specifically, an overlap greater than 2 bases) *only* at its right end; in other words, it demonstrates a substantial overlap when positioned to the left of other reads, but no significant overlap occurs when other reads are positioned to its left. Referencing the example output from `prettyPrint` previously, read '4' would be identified as the first read because its corresponding column (representing reads overlapping '4' on its right) shows no significant overlaps (none larger than two bases). A function is to be implemented with the signature `def findFirstRead(overlaps):` that accepts one argument: the dictionary of dictionaries named `overlaps` returned by the `getAllOverlaps` function. This function must yield a string containing the name of the identified first read."

    "## Problem 7: Determine Read Order\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the identification of the initial read, the correct ordering of the reads can be determined recursively. A list containing the read names arranged in the correct sequential order is desired as the output. This problem lends itself to a recursive solution, where the primary task can be decomposed into a recurring subproblem: finding the read that exhibits the largest overlap at the right end of the current read (this constitutes the recursive case). This process continues until the final (rightmost) read is reached, which is defined as not having any significant overlap (greater than 2 bases) at its right end (this constitutes the base case for the recursion). Within the recursive step, it is necessary to identify precisely which read comes next; that is, the read possessing the largest overlap to the right end of the current read. The `overlaps` dictionary is utilized for this purpose. For example, if the current read is named ‘4’, the dictionary `overlaps['4']` provides information about overlaps with reads positioned to the right of read ‘4’. Therefore, to ascertain the name of the read with the largest overlap in such a scenario, a dedicated function is required that finds the key associated with the largest value within a given dictionary. As a preliminary step, a function with the signature `def findKeyForLargestValue(d):` is to be implemented. This function should accept a dictionary argument `d` and return the key linked to the dictionary's largest value. This helper function is then to be employed as a tool within the subsequent primary function. Implement the main function with the signature `def findOrder(name, overlaps):`. This function accepts two arguments: a string `name` containing the name of the first read (identified in the previous task), and the dictionary argument `overlaps` returned by `getAllOverlaps`. The required return value is a list containing the names of the reads arranged in the correct order representing the genomic sequence."

A function is to be implemented with the signature `def assembleGenome(readOrder, reads, overlaps):`. This function accepts three arguments: a list named `readOrder` containing the names of the reads in their correct sequential order, a dictionary named `reads` as returned by the `readDataFromFile` function, and a dictionary named `overlaps` as returned by the `getAllOverlaps` function. The required return value of this function is a single string containing the fully assembled genomic sequence."
